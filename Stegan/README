Description:

This program hides an arbitrary binary payload inside of a WAVE audio file.
The program is written in Python for use on a standard Linux CCIS machine.

Running:

The program requires no compiling or build process.

All file names must be valid unix paths.

To run on a CCIS Linux machine, change directory into the ./bin folder
and execute either of the following commands:

    ./stegan --encode file1 file2 file3
    ./stegan --decode file4 file5
	
where

    file1 is the name of an existing WAVE or mp3 file that
    contains an audio recording (the "carrier").

    file2 is the name of an existing file (of arbitrary type)
    that contains the binary message to be added to file1.

    file3 is the name of the WAVE or mp3 file to be created
    by adding the binary message in file2 to the recording
    in file1 (the "trojan").

    file4 is the name of an existing WAVE or mp3 file that
    may have been created by this software (as the file3 in
    the --encode direction).

    file5 is the name of a file to be created by extracting
    a binary message from file4, under the assumption that
    file4 was created by this software as the file3 in the
    --encode direction, or meaningless binary data.
